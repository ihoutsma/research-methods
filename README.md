## Abstract
This project investigates if the use of slang has increased in recent years. By using Twitter datasets we try to get information about the use of slang on Twitter and how it has developped
## Background information
Young people express their identity with language, so they developpe their own language to communicate with each other. There are many influences on the type of slang, like ethnic composition, place of residence, bilingual upbringing, etc.(Cornips, 2002). Nowedays street language is often seen as a language used by young immigrants. In recent years, many different cultures have developed in the Netherlands, for example large groups of migrants used to come from a small number of countries and now it is the other way around, which makes the diversity even greater (Jennissen, Engbersen, Hokhorst, Bovens, 2018). There is a bigger chanche that you get in toutch with other types of languages, wich This makes it easier to adopt certain aspects because it becomes more and more pleasant. You'll hear it from you colleagues, friends and family, it's a more fun that 'normal Dutch and it's possible that you can expresss yourself better with slang(Van den Braak, 2002). It is therefore becoming more and more common to use slang.
## Research question and Hypothesis
Research question:<br />
Is there an increase in the use of the words, ‘fissa’ and ‘skeer’ between april 27 2014 and april 27 2022?<br />
Hypothesis:<br />
There is an increase in the use of the words, ‘fissa’ and ‘skeer’ and between april 27 2014 and april 27 2022?<br />
## Method
We need to establish our variables. The dependent variables are the words from slang. The words we have chosen are: 'fissa' and 'skeer', we have chosen these because these words are among the most popular in Dutch slang. The independent variables are the different dates, we chose April 27, 2022 and April 27 2014. We chose King's Day in that year because it's a public holiday and the word 'fissa' means celebration, so this increases the probability that the word on that day was used on Twitter. We have chosen 2022 because it is a year after corona, which means King's Day continued and there were no measures. In 2014 was the first King's day after he was crowned. These variables we need to look up in the Twitter dataset.
